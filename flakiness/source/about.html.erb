<h2>About</h2>
<p>
I'm Hajime Morrita, a programmer in Tokyo, Japan.
I'm working at Google, for contributing a Web browser called Chrome; specifically on Blink rendering engine. Before joining Google, I was working on some small and no-so-small Tokyo based companies on various areas.

<p>
On the Web, I'm using <a href="http://github.com/omo">@omo</a> on GitHub, <a href="https://twitter.com/flakiness">@flakiness</a> on Twitter and <a href="mailto:morrita@chromium.org">morrita@</a> on <a href="http://chromium.org/">Chromium land</a>. I also maintain this <a href="http://flakiness.es/">flakiness.es</a> to publish some writings. If you can read Japanese, you might want to skim <a href="http://steps.dodgson.org/">my another blog</a> which is writtern in the exotic language.
